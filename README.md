Project Title:
A Review of Millennials 

Abstract:
Generation Y aka Millennials describes individuals born from 1981 to 1996. For this project, I wanted to explore the impact of Millennials on our current culture and economy. I was inspired by various news articles that contributed to the "millennials ruin everything" internet phenomenon. This version of the project focus on how the economy looks through the eyes of Millennials.
