Project Title:
A Review of Millennials 

Abstract:
Generation Y aka Millennials describes individuals born from 1981 to 1996. For this project, I wanted to explore the impact of Millennials on our current culture and economy. I was inspired by various news articles that contributed to the "millennials ruin everything" internet phenomenon. Let's explore how love, money, and pop culture look through the eyes of Millennials.

Problem Statement:
What does the world look like for Millennials today?
